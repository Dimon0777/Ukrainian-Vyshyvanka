		<u><b>Zakarpattya embroidery</b></u> (Transcarpathian region) is a surprisingly interesting and extremely diverse thing.
		 From the single-color "Poltava" style "white on white", Zakarpattya embroidery during the 19th and mid-20th centuries developed into an original combination of red and blue on a white background.<br><br>
		 The same process covers ornaments, which evolve from simple geometric objects to complex naturalistic compositions with flowers. The main feature of Zakarpattya ornaments are zigzags, the so-called "curves" that perfectly complemented traditional rhombuses and magnificently decorated both men's and women's shirts.<br><br>
		In total, there were four main types of ornaments in Zakarpattya: Boykiv, Hutsul, Lemkiv, and Uzhhorod.<br><br>
		 <u>Boykivshchyna</u> - a kind of business card of the region was "oplicha" - ancient women's shirts, which were embroidered with two needles at once: a coarse one, stretched with a seam, and a thin one, twisted into a mesh pattern. In addition to the ornaments usual for the region, the fights used mesh and anthropomorphic motifs. Colours: red, blue, white.<br><br>
		<u>Hutsul embroidery</u> is a large number of various techniques: low, stem, stipple, cross, mesh, smooth, topstitching, needlework. Ornaments of Eastern Transcarpathia, based on a rhombus or half-rhomb, as well as other geometric variations. Colour №1 is red in all its shades and manifestations. They are actively embroidering in green, yellow, blue and black.<br><br>
		 <u>Lemkiv region</u>  - at first, geometric ornament dominated here, and only in the 30s of the last century, flowers and plants began to appear, arranged in certain closed compositions. The colour scheme becomes red-blue, and the most popular techniques are cross and smooth.
		<br><br><u>Uzhhorod region</u> - the embroidery of this region was significantly influenced by Slovak and Hungarian motifs. That is why shirts with red-black, red-yellow, pink ornaments (Hungarian trace), as well as dark blue, blue and various combinations with red (Slovak) are popular here.
