		<U><b>Polissya embroideries</b></U> are distinguished by simplicity, but at the same time elegance, miniaturises, a wealth of options and clarity of composition. Restraint of lines and geometric motifs, lack of detail in ornaments and a small number of techniques come to life thanks to the use of red threads, which gives the works brightness and emotionality.<br><br>
			 The most traditional here is geometric embroidery, which belongs to the oldest in the history of mankind and is found in samples of ornaments from different eras and on all continents. And these are not just abstract drawings, they have a very deep symbolic and magical meaning.<br><br>
		Symbolic floral and floral ornaments are also often found in embroideries. Embroidery was not completely naturalistic, rather it was a kind of stylization.<br><br>
			 In some areas of &nbsp;Volyn, embroideries are distinguished by diamond patterns that fit into rectangles. Such ornaments were made alternately with red and blue threads.
