		<u><b>Borschiv embroidery</b></u> is the complete opposite of <u>Poltava</u> embroidery, it can be characterized as shirts with one-piece, slightly voluminous embroidery, the dominant color of which is black, other colors are used only to frame the contours of the embroidered ornaments.
		<br><br>
		According to folk tales and legends, the appearance of borscht shirts embroidered with black threads is explained by tragic historical events. The Borschiv region was the site of constant attacks by Turks and Tatars in the 15th-17th centuries. during such attacks, the population of the region was captured, and the villages were mercilessly devastated. As a result of one of these attacks in several neighboring villages in the Transnistrian region, all the men died, and the women, as a sign of mourning for their relatives, mourning their difficult and tragic fate, vowed to wear mourning for several, as the researchers claim, seven generations, precisely in embroidered shirts black threads They kept their word.
		<br><br>
		Of course, you can find many modern shirts based on the patterns of the ancient clothes of our ancestors, but the most valuable are those ancient shirts that were sewn a century or two ago. Such shirts are called <u>"borscht toys"</u>. The main features of such a <u>"cotton"</u> shirt are the use of bleached home-spun cloth, the use of black woolen thread (the black thread was called "black cotton") and a thick, dense ornament. Shirts created in the 20s and 30s of the last century were embroidered by the last generation, which had to keep that ancient promise.
		<br><br>
		Borschiv shirts are diverse and practically not similar to each other, however, for embroidered women of this region, there was a clear three-tiered system of placement of the ornament on the sleeves. The upper part of the sleeve, as it was called the <u>"set"</u>, was most densely filled with embroidered patterns. Below, under the <u>"inset"</u>, there were so-called <u>"wrinkles"</u>, and below - strips of embroidered patterns up to the wrist, and the strips could be placed either vertically or horizontally, or diagonally. The choice of placement of embroidered stripes depended on the area where the shirt was embroidered.
		<br><br>
		Probably, it is because of their unique feature that borscht black shirts occupy their separate and honorable place among the variety of folk clothing of Ukrainians. The majority of art critics, ethnographers and scientists are of the opinion that Borschiv and Poltava embroidery techniques and ornaments have remained practically in their original form to this day, they have practically not been influenced by other, not quite authentic trends in embroidery.
