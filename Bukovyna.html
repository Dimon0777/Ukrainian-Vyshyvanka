		<u><b>Bukovyna vyshyvanka</b></u>, which in the past was often called <u>"lyapenko"</u> (due to the large number of flowers embroidered with smooth), is currently not only one of the most diverse in terms of the number of styles and ornaments, but also rightfully ranks among the most popular vyshyvankas throughout Ukraine.
		<br><br>
		The process of making vyshyvanka in Bukovina is approached very carefully, the <u>"recipes"</u> are handed down from different generations. In the past, hemp and linen threads were used here, which were dyed with natural dyes. Different families had their secrets in making such dyes: either from flowers, or leaves, or from the bark of plants. In order for you to understand how serious everything is, the Austrian researcher of Bukovyna embroidery, E. Kolbengaier, was engaged in studying the colours of these dyes.
		<br><br>
		The colours of Bukovyna shirts covers virtually the entire rainbow, and in some places even goes beyond it: burgundy, orange, yellow, green, blue, and black colours prevail here, with possible splashes of purple, crimson, blue, and brown.
		<br><br>
		The ornaments were small geometric motifs combined with a geometric plant ornament. The world-famous "Tree of Life" and the classic Ukrainian women's embroidery "Beregynya" were the most popular. In some places you can meet birds and winged horses.
		<br><br>
		In order to give the embroidery even greater brightness and uniqueness, certain of its elements were decorated with metallized gold and silver threads, which were called "khir" in Bukovina.
		<br><br>
		In addition to their variety and popularity, Bukovyna embroidery can boast that they are the heaviest in Ukraine. The approximate weight of an average shirt from Chernivtsi is 10 kg. The reason for such rather impressive numbers is beads, which are abundantly decorated with almost every Bukovyna embroidery.
