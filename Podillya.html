		<u><b>Podillya embroidery</b></u> is the most complex and the most beautiful of all, made in different parts of Ukraine. Podilya is the territory between the <u>Dniester</u> and the <u>Southern Bug</u>. Since ancient times, cloths for future embroidered products have been woven mainly in the black earth regions of Podilya . There were the most suitable conditions for growing hemp, which produced the best fabrics.
		<br><br>
		The color of ripe rye, which is combined in one product with black, is very popular in Podilly. The shirt's rye color was obtained by baking threads sprinkled with chromite in the dough. This method of thread processing gave color intensity and stability. Sometimes, wanting to give the embroidery a greater effect, gold or silver threads were added to the work.
		<br><br>
		The black color itself was also very popular in Podilya embroidery. Sometimes it was combined with dark cherry or red-black, yellow and green were also added. Embroidery with black and blue threads is dominant.
		<br><br>
		The <u>"white on white"</u> embroidery, which is distinguished by various techniques, is very beautiful. In ancient times, shirts embroidered in white on white or yellow on white were made for weddings and therefore required great responsibility, were decorated carefully and expressively.
		<br><br>
		In the first half of the 19th century, embroidery with a <u>floral</u> ornament became the most popular. In the works of this time, one can very often find motifs of these ornaments, such as "burdocks", "sunflower", "holyflower", "hops", "marigolds", "ovysik", "semihorn", "apple", "ruta ", "cream". Various animal ornaments also became quite widespread. Such as "owls", "wrens", "crabs", "frogs", "pigeons", "snake", "carp scale", "leeches", "swallows", "cuckoos" were used, and some ornaments resemble household objects, for example, "combs", "boats", "chains", "ploughshares". You can also find such a motif as "lambs" or "lamb horns" and others.
		<br><br>
		The "snake" motif can be found more often in the north, "pigtails", "ram's horns", "besag", "crayfish" and "kupchak" - in villages on the
		southeast, "ovsyk" - in the east, "infinity" - in the south.
		<br><br>
		In Vinnytsia, men have also been engaged in embroidery since ancient times. Villages such as Klembivka, Yalanets, Horodkivka and Stina are most famous for their embroidery. More refined and flawless products from these villages could often be found at various fairs in Paris, St. Petersburg, Kyiv, and many countries around the world.
		<br><br>In the village of <u>Stina</u>, the favorite color of shirt embroidery is black. Geometric and plant ornament, namely "cornflower", "curls", "grapes", made with a cross or "stapovka" is characteristic of this territory.<br><br>
		Western Podilya likes dark colors. It is usually black in combination with dark red or yellow. The shirts of this region are special in that there are necessarily two lines on the chest, the so-called "breasts", three lines on the back and a richly decorated sleeve. Patterns are made with geometric ornament.
		<br><br>
		The colors of the Ternopil region are not very different, mostly the embroidery here is dark, up to black, the patterns are very thick, they completely cover the sleeves of women's shirts. More floral ornaments, brightness and colors are added to modern Ternopil embroidery.
