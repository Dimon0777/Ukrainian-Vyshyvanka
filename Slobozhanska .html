		The basis of any <u><b>Slobozanschyna</b></u> outfit was a shirt. On holidays, they wore a bright "Dodilna" shirt with an ornament, and in everyday life they did not shy away from "Pidtachena" shirts. At first, it was embroidered only in white on white (a symbol of connection with the ancestors), and only later more interesting combinations appeared, in particular, the combination of red and blue is still popular today. "Completely" with embroidery was lace - an openwork technique that added sophistication and elegance to the dress. A characteristic feature of the eastern regions of Ukraine were netted hems, which were supposed to be visible from under the loincloths - sheets.

		As for the ornament, it could be quite diverse and carry certain coded information, starting from the symbol "tree of life", where the roots are a sign of ancestors, the trunk - modernity, the top - a higher, spiritual world, to the image of freedom - a bird. Another symbol that can often be seen on embroideries are triangles, which, touching each other at the top, symbolize the World and the Anti-World. Sometimes there is a line between the triangles, the so-called "Ring of the Great Glow", which symbolizes the reflection of the two worlds.
