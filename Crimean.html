		<u><B>Crimean Tatar embroidery</B></u>, like the entire Crimean Tatar people, has gone through a difficult path, with its ups and downs, complete disappearances and sudden, somewhat fantastic revivals. <br><br>
				In general, all ornaments can be divided into six groups: plant, geometric, architectural, zoomorphic, epigraphic and mixed. Some also separate astral bodies and dishes (vases with flowers and fruits). And although the symbolism of the ornaments is surprisingly diverse, Crimean Tatar embroidery has a pronounced plant orientation. Zoomorphic and architectural motifs often appear in symbiosis with flowers, trees, fruits, characteristic exclusively for the nature of the Crimean peninsula.<br><br>
		As in Bukovina, the Crimean Tatars sometimes embroidered with beads imported from Iran and Asia Minor. However, if the Bukovyna embroiderers decorated the most solemn items of clothing and household with it, the Crimean Tatar embroiderers used it for things of the "second" order: amulets, purses, cigarette cases, covers, etc. Not too wealthy Tatars replaced pearls with beads.
