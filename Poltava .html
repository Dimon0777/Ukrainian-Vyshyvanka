		<u><b>Poltava Region</b></u> is most famous for its embroidery with white threads on white fabric. Earlier, women embroidered mainly in winter, then there was less housework. Sitting by the window, they watched the patterns that the frost drew on the windows, and then transferred them to the canvas. That's how white-on-white embroidery came about. A legend, you say?! Perhaps, but not far from reality.<br><br>
		  In general, Poltava region's shirts are mostly embroidered with white, less often red, black, or gray threads. Directly, the pattern itself was circled with black or colored stripes.<br><br>
		 Another technique that boasts of sufficient popularity in the Poltava region is carving. There are many types of cutting: oblique, wedge, eagle, single-hole cutting, four-hole cutting, etc. It was with the help of cutting that holes of different sizes were formed in the fabric, which made the shirt even more interesting and unique.<br><br>
		 In addition to the two methods mentioned above, Poltava people use the following: a cross, a tangled cross, a double stick, teeth, a network, a network of sticks, gouging, dovbanka, verchoplut, a laivka in one or more rows, puffs, chains, etc. Such an arsenal of techniques leads to a great variety of motifs in ornaments.<br><br>
		 A compilation of floral and geometric ornaments is a purely original feature of Poltava embroideries. The sleeves of the vyshyvanka, which formed complex thematic compositions and gathered densely on the forearms, were the most subject to the pattern.
