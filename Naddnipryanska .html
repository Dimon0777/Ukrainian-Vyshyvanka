	<div class="Box"><div class="BoxInBox"><span class="text"><u><b>Kyiv region</b></u> is distinguished by a combination of different types of ornaments in embroidery. The most common were geometric (diamonds, squares) and plant (grapes, hops, marigolds, oak leaves, cones) patterns. White, coral-red threads were used for the work, and in order to emphasize the drawing, it was often outlined in blue. Later, due to the fact that the blue threads shed a lot, they were replaced by black ones.
		<br><br>
		<u><b>Western-southern region</b></u> embroidery was made with red threads very coarse in texture, which made the cross-stitched products very bright and expressive.
		<br><br>
		<u><b>Central region</b></u> embroidery was very similar to Poltava embroidery - it was embroidered in white, framing the pattern with black threads. Sewn using smooth, cutting, mesh, dialing. In addition, cross-stitching was done with very fine or coarse thread, which made the work in relief. The patterns, as in the larger territory of the Dnieper region, were geometric and vegetal, sometimes various birds (ducks, eagles, swans, doves) were embroidered.
		<br><br>
	Craftswomen did not have their own style of embroidery - they used techniques and patterns borrowed from other regions, which gave the products a special variety and uniqueness.
