		<u><b>Volyn</b></u> is an ancient Rus historical region that includes modern Volyn and Rivne regions, the western part of Zhytomyr region, and the northern parts of Ternopil and Khmelnytsky regions.
		<br><br>
		Carved wooden ornaments dating back to the Neolithic era (5000-1800 BC) can be considered one of the most interesting archaeological finds in Volyn and Polissya. Pieces of ceramics found in these regions are also generously decorated with rather characteristic ornaments. And all this echo of ancient cultures found a very wide reflection in more modern finds - pieces of clothing cloth. Therefore, ancient patterns such as "herringbone", "diamonds", "triangles", "crosses" were found.
		<br><br>
		The main place in the ornamental art of the Volhynians is occupied by the symbols of water, earth and sun, which form the life-giving trinity. The images of Berehyna, the patroness of life, are also considered traditional; the tree of life, on the branches of which birds are symmetrically located - symbols of the human soul; plant motifs.<br><br>

		The rhythmic alternation of geometric shapes: stars, rhombuses, broken lines is generally common for the Volyn region. Small details, inscribed one into the other, intertwining, form a single ornament. The most common technique is underlining - a very ancient embroidery that imitates shuttle weaving, creating dense, laconic and at the same time exquisite compositions. In this way, a pattern is created that resembles the picturesque Volyn reliefs.
		<br><br>
		As for the colors of the shirts, the red color prevailed in the patterns, and they were also embroidered with blue and black threads.
		<br><br>
		In the southern regions of Volyn, floral motifs prevailed in ornamentation. Shirts near the collar and sleeves were embroidered exclusively with light threads. But the arrangement of a narrow strip of embroidered ornament on the cuff became a frankly West Volyn feature.
		<br><br>
		The First World War, unfortunately, had a significant impact on culture as well. As a result, the Volyn people's order, preserved for centuries, could not withstand the onslaught of European culture, which began to gradually supplant traditions. The ancient tapestry gave way to the Bavarian cross, the Hungarian smooth and the Parisian technique of Richelieu. Geometric ornaments were replaced by floral ones, and in some places they began to embroider birds. The color scheme of the embroidery has also undergone changes – the traditional red color has been replaced by black.
